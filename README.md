### Hi there below is summary about me and the certifications and projects that I worked onðŸ‘‹


   -ðŸ™‚ About me ...
   
      â€¢ The University of Texas at San Antonio Computer Science alumni transitioned into Cybersecurity and
        have previous experience working as an Associate Software Engineer, with a good understanding of
        working with Java technology, in a Front-End and Back-End environment.

      â€¢ I started my Cybersecurity journey by achieving Google Cybersecurity and CompTIA Security+ CE
        certifications. In this certification program, I learned how to identify Social Engineering attacks, how
        to identify threats and vulnerabilities and how to use the incident response process using the NIST
        Cybersecurity framework (RMF, CSF). After getting those certificates, I developed my interest in
        Blue Team roles as SOC Analyst and Security Analyst to get a more in-depth understanding of the
        SOC Analyst roles, so I completed Let's Defend Blue Team training paths (SOC Analyst, Malware
        Analysis, SIEM Engineering, and Incident Responder). These paths practically trained me in how to
        perform malware analysis (static and dynamic) using a sandbox environment, how to use different
        CLI and GUI tools for identifying IoC and malicious code, and how to solve alert tickets in an
        interactive SIEM dashboard similar to the one that is used in the SOC Analyst work environment. I
        also worked on some projects to get a better understanding of using these tools.

      â€¢ These skills helped me to achieve my CompTIA CySA+ CE certification. In this certification
        program, I learned how to manage vulnerabilities using a proactive approach, how to read endpoints,
        network and application logs, and how to correlate them in SIEM, as well as how to manage incident
        and response processes, and how to perform reporting and communication of different types of
        vulnerabilities and incidents using reactive approach.
