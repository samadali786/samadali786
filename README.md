### Hi there below is summary about me and the certifications and projects that I worked on👋


   -🙂 About me ...
   
      • The University of Texas at San Antonio Computer Science alumni has experience working as an
        Associate Software Engineer, with a good understanding of working with Java technology, in a Front-
        End and Back-End work environment of software development, as well as a good understanding of
        data analytic process by organize, analyze, and visualize data sets using database tools (MS Excel, MS
        SQL Server, R-studio, Tableau).

      • Recently moved into the field of Cybersecurity, having a good understanding of identifying threats
       and vulnerabilities, malware analysis, incident and response process by using NIST framework (RMF,
       CSF), use of SIEM tools (Splunk), and network packet analyzer tools (Wireshark, Tcpdump) that I
       learned in my Google Cybersecurity certification program. I am also a CompTIA Security+ certified
       in this certification program I got more technical understanding of how to secure systems, and
       networks (LAN, WAN) from ongoing network and social engineering attacks. Moreover, I also
       completed Lets’ Defend blue team training paths (SOC Analyst, Malware Analysis, and Incident
       Responder), these paths practically trained me how to use SOC Analyst tools, and how to solve alert
       tickets using an interactive SIEM dashboard similar to the SIEM dashboard use in SOC Analysts work
       environment, I am also good at troubleshooting tasks related to hardware and software issues.
